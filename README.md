# Origin
This is a new repo of mine. At the origin, I had a discussion on Facebook DL groups about
n-class classification. After the discussion, someone gave me the idea of writing some code
on it, and after finishing the major part of that code, when I tried to push the code to
my github, I just realized that I have no suitable repo to fit this kind of theme.

That's the origin of this repo. In the future, from time to time, I will try to add sth here, maybe
anything related to Deep Learning.
