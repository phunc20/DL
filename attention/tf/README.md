## The Notebooks
`image_captioning_o{k}.ipynb` where `k = 01, 02, ...` are the exactly same notebooks that I downloaded directly
from TensorFlow's website, with only slight modification to adapt locally on my machines.
- `image_captioning_o01.ipynb`: Same notebook as on the website, only that
  - Since I have already once extracted features of training images (wrongly),
    I had to retrieve these `.npy` files and manually made them the training image features in this notebook.

`image_captioning_v{k}.ipynb` where `k = 01, 02, ...` are notebooks which I typed by hand when reading the tutorial on
TensorFlow's website.
- `image_captioning_v01.ipynb`
  - The first version. Cannot be run on a machine which has formerly run `image_captioning_v01.ipynb` once already.
- `image_captioning_v02.ipynb`
  - Contrary to `v01`, this `v02` can be run any number of times on any machine w/o having to
    re-download and re-run repetitive time-consuming tasks.
