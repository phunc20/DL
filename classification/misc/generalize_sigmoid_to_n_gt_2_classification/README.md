## Origin
I have this question that I asked on both a facebook group in Taiwan and one in Vietnam.

Originally I did not have even the slightest intension to write anything on it, let alone saying coding on it,
because I did not even know an answer!
I was just curious about why people didn't chooose to do n-class classification using similar ideas in using sigmoid.

During the discussion with `Lenny Fan`, he made me realize that I had overlooked sth.
That sth I have written in the comments of both posts. Here is a quick implementation of that idea.

Note that
- I am not proposing sth great to replace the standard way of doing n-class classification, so don't send me messages arguing with me that I was wrong, etc. etc.
- Instead, I totally support the idea of the standard way of doing it. Here, I am just trying to show **the reason why DL engineers hadn't chosen other ways**.

Hope this small discussion may be helpful to anyone who falls upon.
